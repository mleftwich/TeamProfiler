  ## Description
  Application to generate a HTML page based on user input provided in the terminal. Using node.js and the inquirer, and filesystem dependencies user runs the application and receives prompts to enter information about different employees in a team. Upon completion the individual employees are logged in an array and sent to an outputHTML function which renders the information into HTML format with corresponding team member cards. You can see a demonstration of the app in use [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d_rC9T7u5VgOmP0RMNBZq2tVw5yNGSzS/view).
